gentoo-scripts
==============

This is basically the config for my personal Gentoo dev installation. It is perfectly fine-tuned to how I like things to be configured. Feel free to use it as a base or an example for a new gentoo install.

The concept is that you would run install.sh (with some possible minor modifications such as changing /dev/vda to /dev/sda) to do the whole gentoo install. Also contained in this repo are config files, USE flags, and various other config options.

The default install creates a PHP LAMP server with no multilib for amd64.
